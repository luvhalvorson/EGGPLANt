# EGGPLANt
A playful app fits your personal life into class schedule! <br>
We want to help students easily manage their class schedule, reminders, calendar and sync with LMS for tracking assignments and upcoming exams.

> This is a demo app so far, but our team will still be working hard on it :)

## A teeny tiny story about our app...
EGGPLANt is a project for free 10-day iOS app summer workshop at University of Taipei.<br>
For each group in this workshop, we had project manager, designer, developer which most of us were totally new to our "roles".<br>
Different courses had be given to help us acquire knowledge and skills based on our roles in the team and finally we got together to create this app.
